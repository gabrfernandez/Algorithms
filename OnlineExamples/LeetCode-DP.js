//Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

//time o(n) single loop to n
//space o(n), new arr created

//300 Longest Increasing Subsequence
//Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
//A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements 
//without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
//For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

//Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
//A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some 
//characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. 
//(eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings 
//is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
